## something to keep in mind
This is project under development with no roadmap and no schedule. As I'm develope this during my spare time, it may happen that updates and enhancements take a while.
## objective
Create an application that extracts metadata from a Power BI Environment using the Power BI Admin Scanner REST APIs.
At the current moment I develop this application using PowerShell, use Azure Blob storage to store the JSON documents that contain metadata.
Power BI is used to visualize the metadata.

## requirements
I use Visual Studio code for the development of the PowerShell scrips, you can find Visual Studio Code here: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download

The following Power modules are used
- MicrosoftPowerBIMgmt
- SqlServer
- Az.Storage
